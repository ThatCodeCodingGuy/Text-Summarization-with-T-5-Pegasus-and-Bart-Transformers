# Text-Summarization-with-T-5-Pegasus-and-Bart-Transformers
This project uses T-5, Pegasus and Bart transformers with HuggingFace library for text summarization applied on a news dataset in Kaggle.

By HuggingFace library, I use "t5-base" model of T-5, "google/pegasus-xsum" model of Pegasus and "facebook/bart-large-cnn" model of Bart transformers to summarize the news
texts in the dataset. 

I use Tensorflow framework for T-5 and Pegasus and PyTorch for Bart.

Aside from the dataset, I use a single text from a news article and apply all three transformer models to it in order to see clearly what the performances of these models are compared to each other.

* The Full Text: "France has lifted its blanket ban on UK travellers from today, 14 January, enabling vaccinated tourists to return. The countryâ€™s tourism minister announced the news on Twitter yesterday, with more official details expected to follow today. Since 18 December, only those with "compelling reasons" have been allowed to travel from Britain to France in a bid to stem the spread of the Omicron variant. The welcome news has led to a surge of holiday bookings from those eager to hit the slopes. According to easyJet, flights to popular French ski destinations are up by 600 per cent since the rules eased, with a peak in trips to Switzerland too as double-jabbed Brits can now pass through France to resorts over the border. But there is still plenty of COVID travel admin to contend with, as we explain below. France requires all UK travellers to present a negative COVID-19 test - either antigen or PCR - taken within 24 hours before departure. Antigen tests must be certified by a laboratory and NHS lateral flow test kits are not allowed. Privately booked lateral flow test kits can be used at home though, such as the Randox lateral flow test kit. After testing, users can submit their results via an app and the results will be certified by a laboratory. Users will then receive a travel certificate to present at the airport. Arrivals from the Schengen zone only need to present a negative test, taken in the 24 hours prior to departing, if they are not fully vaccinated."
# Results:

# T-5:
'only those with 'compelling reasons' allowed to travel from uk to france. flights to popular french ski destinations up by 600 per cent since rules eased. but there is still plenty of COVID travel admin to contend with.'
# Pegasus:
'Britons heading to French ski resorts have been given the all-clear to return.'
# Bart:
'Since 18 December, only those with "compelling reasons" have been allowed to travel from Britain to France. France requires all UK travellers to present a negative COVID-19 test - either antigen or PCR - taken within 24 hours before departure. Antigen tests must be certified by a laboratory and NHS lateral flow test kits are not allowed.'

# Conclusion:
From this example, Bart seems to be the best transformer for summarization. However, it needs to be said that parameters of T-5 and Pegasus can be tweaked for higher performance.
Additionally, instead of "t5-base", other more developed models (e.g. "t5-large, "t5-3b", and "t5-11b") can be used for better performance.
